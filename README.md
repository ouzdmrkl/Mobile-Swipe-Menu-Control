# Mobile-Swipe-Menu-Control
Basic project that allows you to change character and paint character with swipe.

I made a simple character menu with swipe controls. You can change character by swiping left and right. And you can change character color by swiping up and down.
I also tried to make code clean. You can implement swipe system in your project easily.
